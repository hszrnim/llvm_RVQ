# llvm_RVQ

Sup guys, I'm the author of this project, hszrnim.
It's my pleasure to share this project with you.
This is a C++/C to RISCV (Quantr format) compiler based on the LLVM compiler,
for further CPU development.

Instead of simply translating between languages,
a new feature of it is outputing a brand new executable format, ".qr".

This is purely an experimental hobby project,
since I have literally 0 experience in LLVM,
hope everything is on the right track :)
